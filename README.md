# HERCULEAN

## Overview

**You can find the live site on [Heroku](https://herculean-store.herokuapp.com/)**

### Why was it created?

This is the end of stream three - and my final overall - project for [Code Institute's](https://www.codeinstitute.net/)
Full Stack Web Developer course. This site is the culmination of all my hard work over
the last year and a half and includes front-end and back-end, the whole shebang.
The site is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Python and Django.

### Its purpose?

To function as a fully-fledged e-commerce website, using Stripe's API to process the payments.

## Features

The site is primarily designed as a fitness store, but also houses customer accounts and fitness
articles in the form of a blogpost layout.

### Major areas of the site
- User account area
  - Ability to see other users' public profiles
- Product pages
  - Reviews and rating system
- Fitness news from staff
  - Commenting using Disqus
- Cart and checkout
  - Promo code functionality
  
## Technology

### Major tech used:
- [Django 2.0](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - The main framework and driving force behind Herculean
- [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - I use a lot of custom CSS too, but Bootstrap makes life easier
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  - Minor scripting required on the site, mostly done using jQuery
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
  - Stripe handles all user payments
- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
  - Disqus enables commenting on the fitness articles
- [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/)
  - Provides the default avatar for those too bashful to upload a picture
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  - AWS hosts the static and media files using [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## Acknowledgements

As always, I'd like to give the biggest thanks imaginable to [Matt Rudge](https://github.com/lechien73)
of the [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/) for his persistent wisdom and sometimes
bacon saving knowledge. He has been my personal mentor throughout this course and I couldn't have asked for
a better ally. So thank you, Matt.

I'd like to thank the folks at [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/), who provide quality
themes and templates for developers to use. The home page and the individual product pages were loosely
based on templates provided by Start Bootstrap; however, they have been largely changed from their initial
layout. Having never built an e-commerce site before, the templates gave a good idea of where to go more than
anything. I like to be original.
